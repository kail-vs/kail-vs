## Hi there

# I am Kailash    

I’m a Data Engineer who enjoys building pipelines that don’t just move data, but actually make it useful. My work spans **Python, SQL, Spark, Kafka, and Azure**, often blending with **AI/ML** when the use case calls for it. I like solving problems by simplifying them — whether it’s rethinking a telecom mediation flow, streaming weather data in real time, or curating crypto markets into meaningful dashboards.

## Projects  

### [Crypto Data Pipeline](https://github.com/kail-vs/crypto-pipeline)  
End-to-end pipeline that ingests live cryptocurrency data from the CoinGecko API, processes it through a **Bronze → Silver → Gold** architecture, and makes it queryable in **Azure Synapse**. Includes **CI/CD workflows** for automated deployment and a **Power BI dashboard** that tracks market trends and top performers in near real time.  

### [Real-Time Weather Streaming Pipeline](https://github.com/kail-vs/weather-pipeline)   
Dockerized solution for live weather analytics. Uses **Kafka + Spark Structured Streaming** for ingestion and aggregations, stores results in **PostgreSQL**, and serves an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**. Designed to run with a single `docker compose up`, complete with optional **pgAdmin** for inspection.

## Currently Exploring  

- Scaling data workflows with **Databricks** and advanced **Azure** services  
- Building more resilient streaming systems with **Kafka** and **Spark**  
- Experimenting with **.NET MAUI** apps when I step away from data projects

## Beyond Work  

I spend a lot of time thinking and questioning rather than just accepting the default answers. Most of my “hobbies” loop back into tech — tinkering with Linux distros, prototyping small apps, or exploring tools just for curiosity’s sake. When I’m not coding, I usually dive into thought experiments and challenge traditional ideas.
