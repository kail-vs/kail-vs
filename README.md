## About Me

I work on the systems behind data — how it is ingested, shaped, moved, and made reliable at scale.

My focus is on building platforms and pipelines that are not just functional, but production-ready — designed for reliability, observability, and long-term evolution. Much of my work sits at the intersection of batch and streaming systems, telecom mediation, and cloud analytics, where data volume, latency, and correctness all matter at once.

I’m particularly interested in pipeline architecture, data modeling, workflow orchestration, and platform modernization — from redesigning legacy telecom flows to migrating fragmented stacks into unified lakehouse systems.

> I treat tools as enablers — the real goal is designing systems that scale cleanly and stay maintainable.

## Projects

### 🔹 [Data Pipeline Modernization — Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse](https://github.com/kail-vs/de-on-fabric)  
Re-architected an Azure crypto pipeline into a unified Fabric Lakehouse platform to resolve performance and operational fragmentation. Consolidated ingestion and transformation into medallion layers using Spark notebooks and Fabric pipelines, while optimizing storage from JSONL + GZIP to Parquet + Snappy for faster querying.

---

### 🔹 [Crypto Data Pipeline (Azure)](https://github.com/kail-vs/crypto-pipeline)  
End-to-end ingestion and analytics pipeline built on Azure. Processes live crypto market data through Bronze → Silver → Gold layers using Functions, Data Factory, Blob Storage, and Synapse, with Power BI dashboards for near real-time insights.

---

### 🔹 [Real-Time Weather Streaming Pipeline](https://github.com/kail-vs/weather-pipeline)  
Dockerized streaming platform using Kafka + Spark Structured Streaming. Aggregates live weather data, stores it in PostgreSQL, and visualizes results through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

## Beyond Work

I spend a lot of time thinking and questioning rather than just accepting default answers. Most of my hobbies loop back into tech — tinkering with Linux systems, prototyping apps, or exploring tools out of curiosity.
